*** Apply changes to Multiple Files ***
SED supports globbing via wildcards: *, ?

 Make a copy of the animals.txt file say animals3.txt
 Verify that you have 3 animals files there in your directory.
 sed -ne 's/\(.*\)\([0-9]\)$/\1 \2' animals*.txt
 
 
*** SED Scripts ***
Note: SED supports scripting , which means, the ability to dump 1 or more instructions 
	in to 1 file.

sed -f script_file_name text_file

sed -f animals.sed animals.txt

Task: 
Perform multiple transformations on animals.txt file
 1. /^$/d - Remove blank lines
 2. s/dog/frog/Ig - substitutes globally, 'dog' with 'frog' - (case-insensitive)
 3. s/tiger/lion/Ig - substitutes globally, 'tiger' with 'lion' - (case-insensitive)
 4. s/.*/Animals: &/ - Interspersed 'Animals: '
 5. s/animals/mammals/Ig - Replaced 'Animals' with 'mammals'
 6. s/([a-z]*\)\([0-9]*\)/\1/Ip - Strips trailing numeric values from alphas
 
Randomly add spaces to the animals3.txt file and execute the sed script on this file.

SED Scripting Rules:
 1. SED applies ALL rules to each lines
 2. SED applies ALL changes dynamically to the pattern spaces
 3. SED ALWAYS works with the current line
